## 1. Overview
Project Rio is a data visualization project based on law data in Brazil. These legal data which is provied by a brazil company includes cases happens each state all around Brazil, cases handled by different lawyers, justices, courts etc. My job is to create a web application to display all the data in a elegant and user-friendly way.

## 2. Technical 
a. Framework: C# MVC

b. Front-end Framework: Knockout.js MVVM

c. Third Part front-end Library: JQWidget, Fusion Chart

## 3. Features
a. Mobile Friendly

</p>

This project is based on responsive design which means it will work well among all kinds of device including Phones, tablets and laptops.

b. Interactive maps for data displaying

</p>

In order to display the data in a more friendly and directly way, we attach all the data onto the map of Brazil. The number on each state indicates the number of cases occur in that state. If user click on the state, a detailed state map will show the number of cases in each city of that state. All the click on the states and cities will update the top statistics above.

c. Muti-dimensional and dynamic data searching

The data in our system has various of dimensions such as time, locations, defendants, plaintiff, lawyers, justices and so on. We make all the dimensions dynamic which means users can search on all dimensions and select any specific dimensions. In this way, users can view data from 360 degrees. 

d. Muti-language support

Both English and Portuguese are supported in the system and the system is also scalable for future language support.

e. Dynamic UI for top statistics

Fundamentally, system shows four top statistics of four dimensions when users first log in. But they can also customize the dashborad by drag different dimensions into the top statistics area to make it more personalized. 

## 4. Summary
This project is implemented with the help of my colleagues during my internship. It is kind of a basic prototype for demo. But all the technology used in the system is very popular and advanced. And the system is also scalable and robust. There are also many other features and functions need to be added to the projet since I don't have enough time to finish it during my internship.
